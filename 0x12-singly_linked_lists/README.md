#0x12-singly_linked_lists

#Intro
Contains projects focused on singly linked lists

#Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Dont forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

Please use this data structure for this project:

/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;

#Tasks

0. Print list [Mandatory]

Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf

File: 0-print_list.c

1. List length [Mandatory]

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Prototype: size_t list_len(const list_t *h);

File: 1-list_len.c

2. Add node [Mandatory]

Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

File: 2-add_node.c

3. Add node at the end [Mandatory]

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

File: 3-add_node_end.c

4. Free list [Mandatory]

Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);

File: 4-free_list.c

5. The Hare and the Tortoise [Advanced]

Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

You are allowed to use the printf function

File: 100-first.c
